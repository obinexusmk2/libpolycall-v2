# Zero-Trust Security Architecture for LibPolyCall Configuration

## Overview

This document outlines the zero-trust security architecture implemented in the LibPolyCall configuration validation system. The architecture ensures that all component configurations undergo rigorous security validation before being accepted, minimizing the risk of insecure configurations being deployed.

## Core Zero-Trust Principles Applied

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**:
   - All configurations require explicit validation
   - No defaults that bypass security controls
   - Strict validation of all network-exposed services

2. **Least Privilege**:
   - Components only receive minimal required permissions
   - Default deny approach for all security-sensitive settings

3. **Assume Breach**:
   - All configurations validated for potential security exposures
   - Port conflict detection to prevent unauthorized services

4. **Explicit Verification**:
   - Authentication required for all components
   - Encryption required for all network communications
   - Audit logging enforced for all access

## Architecture Components

The zero-trust security architecture consists of the following key components:

### 1. Security Validation Context

The `polycall_security_validation_context_t` manages the security validation state and enforces security policies through configurable enforcement flags:

- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_AUTH`: Enforces authentication requirements
- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_ENCRYPTION`: Enforces encryption requirements
- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_INTEGRITY`: Enforces data integrity controls
- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_ISOLATION`: Enforces component isolation
- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_AUDIT`: Enforces audit logging
- `ZERO_TRUST_ENFORCE_LEAST_PRIV`: Enforces least privilege

### 2. Network Security Controls

Advanced network security controls include:

- **Comprehensive Port Validation**: Validates ports against validity, privilege, and common service conflicts
- **Port Conflict Detection**: Maintains a registry of port usage to prevent conflicts
- **Ephemeral Port Detection**: Identifies and warns about usage of ephemeral ports that may cause reliability issues

### 3. Component-Specific Security Validation

Each component type has tailored security validation:

- **Micro Component**: Validates authentication, isolation, and audit requirements
- **Edge Component**: Validates network ports, authentication, and encryption
- **Network Component**: Validates encryption and TLS settings
- **Protocol Component**: Validates transport security settings

### 4. Integration with Schema Validation

The security validation system integrates with the existing schema validation to provide a unified validation pipeline:

- Schema validation first ensures structural correctness
- Security validation then ensures security policy compliance
- Error reporting unified across both systems

## Validation Flow

1. Configuration is loaded from file or created programmatically
2. Schema validation confirms structure and base constraints
3. Zero-trust security validation applies security policies
4. Validation hooks allow customization of the validation process
5. Any validation failures result in detailed error messages
6. Only configurations passing both schema and security validation are accepted

## Key Security Features

### Port Security

- **Privilege Enforcement**: Prevents unprivileged use of privileged ports (0-1023)
- **Reserved Port Protection**: Validates against common service ports (HTTP, DNS, database ports, etc.)
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents multiple components from using the same port
- **Ephemeral Port Detection**: Warns about using ports in ephemeral ranges (49152-65535)

### Authentication & Encryption

- Enforces authentication requirements for all components
- Requires encryption for all network communications
- Ensures secure defaults for TLS and protocol security

### Resource Isolation

- Enforces appropriate isolation levels based on component security requirements
- Prevents components from running with insufficient isolation

### Audit & Monitoring

- Ensures all components have audit logging enabled
- Enforces security event tracking for access controls

## Integration Points

The system integrates into:

1. **Configuration Loading Pipeline**: Validates during configuration load
2. **Component Creation**: Validates before component instantiation
3. **Runtime Configuration Changes**: Validates dynamic configuration updates

## Future Enhancements

1. Certificate validation and management
2. Runtime security policy updates
3. Integration with threat intelligence
4. Machine learning-based anomaly detection for configurations

## Conclusion

The zero-trust security architecture for LibPolyCall configuration validation provides a robust framework for ensuring that all components adhere to strict security requirements. By integrating security validation into the configuration system, security becomes an integral part of the configuration process rather than an afterthought.
